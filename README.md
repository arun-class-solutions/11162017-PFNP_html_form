# HTML Form

- In this lab we will be practicing HTML tags by building a HTML form.
- Open index.html in your code editor.
- For each comment denoted by `<!-- -->` replace the comment text with the correct HTML as per the instruction to create the form.
- Alter the CSS file to use a Google Fonts font. You will need to use the `font-family` CSS property.
- **Bonus:** Use CSS to change the background color of the page. Experiment with using images as backgrounds as well.
- **Double Bonus:** Review the CSS `transition` property documentation and try to create a small animation anywhere on the form. An example may be to highlight a border around a form field when it is clicked.
